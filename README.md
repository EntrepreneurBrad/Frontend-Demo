# Overview

This repository contains a front-end demo for a landing page, designed to replicate a given design (https://salient.tailwindui.com) as closely as possible. The goal of this demo is to accurately showcase the structure, layout, and styling of the provided design, ensuring that the front-end implementation mirrors the intended visual and interactive elements. This demo serves as a practical example for developers to follow when creating similar landing pages.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** For the structure of the page.
- **CSS3:** For styling, including Flexbox and Grid for layout.
- **JavaScript (Optional):** For interactivity and dynamic elements.
- **Bootstrap:** Used for responsive grid and common UI components.
